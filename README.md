## Background

### Rational Splitting Algorithms
While much machine learning is done with a random choice between training/test/validation data, an alternative is the use of so-called "rational" splitting algorithms. These approaches use some similarity-based algorithm to divide data into sets. Some of these algorithms include Kennard-Stone, minimal test set dissimilarity, and sphere exclusion algorithms [as discussed by Tropsha et. al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ci300338w) as well as the DUPLEX, OptiSim, D-optimal, as discussed in [Applied Chemoinformatics: Achievements and Future Opportunities](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Applied+Chemoinformatics%3A+Achievements+and+Future+Opportunities-p-9783527806546). Some clustering-based splitting techniques have also been introduced, such as [DBSCAN](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1016.890&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and [K-Means](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1062936X.2017.1397056?casa_token=haxULqeF0z8AAAAA%3AvR3lda-YbtJeOhz22Bfs4TiuTB87PhRxBc1ziZoOhzK1A4pdtAsKRw7zAMqAtUCcx9W83DR7AnfrMg).
[SPXY] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003991400500192X) is another rational splitting technique that takes into account the input as well as the response space. [Time split](https://pubs-acs-org.udel.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1021/ci400084k) is a data splitting technique that divides the data based on time of collection and gives a good indication of the predictive power of models to unseen data. A [residual based method (RBM)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00044-014-1193-8) was proposed which divided the data based on the sign of the residuals generated by fitting a predictive model to the entire dataset.
